As an experienced Data Scientist and Full Stack Developer, I have acquired extensive proficiency in various programming languages, web and mobile applications development, data analysis, and data-driven solutions. With over three years of experience as a Data Scientist and over five years as a Full Stack Developer and Technical Expert, I have worked on diverse projects that have enabled me to develop exceptional skills in analyzing, planning, and implementing technology projects. 

I hold a Master's degree in Computing from Birzeit University, where I am currently employed as a Data Scientist. In my current role, I am responsible for analyzing, planning, and implementing technology projects for the university. My involvement in various projects such as the Palestinian Archive, the Archaeological Collections, and the University Museum, has required me to use different databases, frameworks, and tools to create and maintain websites, applications, and systems that improve the accessibility, usability, and security of the university's data and resources. Additionally, I supervise and support technical personnel, ensuring that quality standards and project schedules are met.

My passion lies in leveraging data and technology to advance research, education, and social impact in Palestine and beyond. I am actively seeking a Data Scientist position with a forward-moving company that shares my vision and values. With my extensive experience in Data Science and Full Stack Development, I am confident in my ability to contribute to the success of any organization.
